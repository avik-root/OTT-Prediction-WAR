# Unveiling the OTT King: Powering Sponsorship Decisions at SNU
## AVIK SAMANTA & RITAM PARUI
## Project Overview
[cite_start]This project uses a data-driven approach to identify the most dominant Over-The-Top (OTT) platform among students at Sister Nivedita University (SNU)[cite: 3]. [cite_start]The goal is to provide valuable insights for strategic sponsorship opportunities by understanding student engagement in the digital environment[cite: 3]. [cite_start]The analysis is powered by a predictive model that determines a student's top OTT platform based on their viewing preferences and habits[cite: 17].

## Data and Methodology
[cite_start]The research is based on a robust analytical framework[cite: 29].

* [cite_start]**Dataset:** A comprehensive survey was conducted with 111 SNU students, with the dataset refined to 100 data points after cleaning[cite: 32].
* [cite_start]**Key Variables:** The study analyzed preferred movie and series genres, binge frequency, and screen time[cite: 33]. [cite_start]The target variable was the dominant OTT platform ("Ott Top1")[cite: 34].
* [cite_start]**Data Cleaning:** Inconsistencies in the "Screen Time" column (e.g., "hrs", "to" ranges) and missing values were handled[cite: 36].
* [cite_start]**Model:** A **Random Forest Classifier** was employed for its ability to handle diverse feature types and its robustness[cite: 38, 54].
* [cite_start]**Evaluation:** The model's performance was evaluated using standard metrics like **accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score**, visualized with a **confusion matrix**[cite: 39].

## Key Findings
[cite_start]The predictive model points unequivocally to **Netflix** as the dominant OTT platform among SNU students[cite: 60].

* [cite_start]**Model Performance:** While the overall model accuracy was 40% [cite: 56][cite_start], it showed a clear strength in predicting Netflix, with a precision of 0.50 and a recall of 0.78[cite: 57].
* [cite_start]**Student Preferences:** This dominance is likely attributed to Netflix's extensive content library, which aligns with popular student genres such as **Thriller, Action**, and **Crime**[cite: 51, 52, 62].

## Strategic Impact for Sponsors
[cite_start]This data-driven insight provides a clear strategic advantage for potential sponsors[cite: 65].

* [cite_start]**Targeted Outreach:** Sponsors can focus their marketing efforts on platforms and content that directly resonate with the majority of SNU students, ensuring higher engagement[cite: 67].
* [cite_start]**Content Alignment:** Understanding popular genres allows sponsors to align their brand messaging with the types of content students consume, fostering a more authentic connection[cite: 69].
* [cite_start]**Optimized Investment:** By backing the dominant platform, sponsors can maximize their return on investment[cite: 71].

## Next Steps & Recommendations
[cite_start]Future enhancements to this research include expanding the dataset and incorporating open-ended feedback[cite: 76, 77].

[cite_start]For sponsors, the recommendation is to **prioritize collaborations with Netflix** for SNU-specific events, promotions, or content integration[cite: 80]. [cite_start]Sponsors should also develop **genre-specific campaigns** (e.g., around Crime or Thriller) and **tailor promotions to binge-watchers**[cite: 81, 82].
